This repository contains a PHP-based backend showcase project designed to demonstrate backend development skills, API design best practices, and real-world server-side architecture.
The backend runs on a virtual machine (VM) and provides a RESTful API consumed by a React frontend application.
It exposes endpoints for fetching, updating, and managing data through secure and well-structured controllers.
